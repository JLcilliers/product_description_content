## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

Once deployed, test your application:

3. **Test export:**
   - Click "Export to Word"
   - Verify document downloads

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check Build Logs** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Common issues:**
   - Missing environment variable (add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
   - Build timeout (normal for first deployment)

### If API doesn't work:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Ensure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is added
3. Redeploy by clicking "Redeploy" → "Redeploy with existing Build Cache"
