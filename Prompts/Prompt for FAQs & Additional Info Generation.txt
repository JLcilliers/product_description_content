**Self-Check Protocol** (Execute before output):
```json
{
  "relevance_check": "Does each Q&A relate directly to this specific product?",
  "search_check": "Would people actually search these questions on Google?",
  "answer_directness": "Does each answer start with the direct response?",
  "length_check": "Questions 8-15 words, answers 40-60 words?",
  "value_check": "Does each answer provide actionable information?",
  "uk_compliance": "Are UK standards/regulations correctly referenced?",
  "natural_language": "Do questions sound like real customer queries?",
  "snippet_optimization": "Would answers work as featured snippets?",
  "concern_coverage": "Are common buyer concerns addressed?",
  "technical_accuracy": "Are all technical claims verifiable?",
  "uniqueness_check": "Is each Q&A covering different aspects?"
}
```

**Output Contract**:
Return ONLY the Q&A pairs. Format as "Q: [question]" on one line, "A: [answer]" on next line, blank line between pairs. No numbering, bullets, or additional formatting.

**Example Output Format**:
Q: What power supply does this cement mixer require?
A: This mixer requires a standard UK 230V single-phase supply with 13A socket. It draws 650W during operation, making it suitable for domestic power outlets. Always use an RCD protection device on construction sites for safety compliance.

Q: Can this mixer handle dry mix screed preparation?
A: Yes, it effectively mixes dry screed materials when water is added gradually during rotation. The 140L drum provides adequate capacity for most screed applications. For optimal results, load dry materials first, then add water slowly while mixing.

Q: How often should the drum be cleaned after use?
A: Clean the drum immediately after each use while concrete residue is still wet. A quick rinse with water and aggregate tumble prevents build-up that reduces capacity. Weekly deep cleaning with diluted brick acid maintains optimal performance.

Q: Is this mixer suitable for continuous commercial use?
A: This model handles intermittent commercial use with regular breaks for motor cooling. The thermal protection prevents overheating during extended operation. For continuous heavy-duty mixing beyond 4 hours daily, consider industrial-rated alternatives.

Q: What's the difference between 110V and 230V models?
A: The 230V model suits fixed workshops with standard power, while 110V versions meet construction site safety requirements. Both deliver identical 650W mixing power. Site work requires 110V with appropriate transformer for HSE compliance.

Q: Does the warranty cover wearing parts like drums?
A: The 12-month warranty covers manufacturing defects but excludes normal wear items like drum paddles. Regular maintenance and proper cleaning significantly extend component life. Replacement parts remain available through Gerald McDonald's parts service.

Q: Can one person safely operate and move this mixer?
A: Yes, the integrated wheel kit and balanced design allow single-person repositioning when empty. The tilt mechanism includes safety locks preventing unexpected drum movement. However, two-person operation is recommended when pouring full loads.
