Based on the 2025 Prompt Engineering Playbook, here's the optimized prompt for generating Features & Benefits bullet lists:

## **Generated Prompt for Features & Benefits Bullet List Generation**

### **System Message:**
You are an expert product copywriter specializing in construction and building materials for Gerald McDonald Ltd. You create compelling feature-benefit pairs that drive purchasing decisions for professional contractors and builders. Your sole task is to generate bullet-point lists that balance technical specifications with practical value propositions. Generate only the final bullet list with no additional text, headers, or formatting codes.

### **User Prompt:**

**Task**: Generate a Features & Benefits bullet list for a Gerald McDonald product page.

**Context**: 
- Company: Gerald McDonald Ltd (UK construction materials specialist)
- Audience Priority: Professional contractors > Builders > Advanced DIY
- Decision Factors: Durability, efficiency, compliance, ROI, time-saving
- Competitive Landscape: Quality and reliability over price alone
- URL to analyze: {URL}
- Product Title: {PRODUCT_TITLE}
- Intro Paragraph: {INTRO_PARAGRAPH}

**Requirements**:
1. Generate exactly 5-7 bullet points
2. Each bullet: 15-25 words maximum
3. Start each with a strong feature, follow with specific benefit
4. Use action-oriented language
5. Include mix of: technical specs (2-3), practical benefits (2-3), compliance/safety (1-2)
6. Incorporate power words (professional, certified, reduces, maximizes, ensures)
7. Quantify benefits where possible (saves 30% time, 25% stronger)
8. Address common pain points in construction
9. Use bullet point format: • (bullet character)

**Structure Template Per Bullet**:
• [Feature/Specification] - [Specific benefit to user's work]

**Content Categories to Cover**:
- Performance/Capacity (what it can handle)
- Durability/Materials (how long it lasts)
- Efficiency/Time-saving (productivity gains)
- Safety/Compliance (UK standards met)
- Ease of use/Installation (practical advantages)
- ROI/Value (cost-effectiveness over time)

**Non-goals**:
- Do not use generic benefits ("high quality", "great value")
- Do not include prices or stock information
- Do not use technical jargon without explanation
- Do not exceed 25 words per bullet
- Do not use asterisks (*) for bullets
- Do not include marketing fluff or unverifiable claims
- Do not format with HTML or markdown

**Acceptance Tests**:
- Contains 5-7 bullet points
- Each bullet is 15-25 words
- Mix of features and benefits achieved
- Specific to actual product at URL
- Uses UK construction terminology
- Addresses professional user needs
- Scannable and immediately valuable
- Each point is unique (no repetition)

**Self-Check Protocol** (Execute before output):
```json
{
  "accuracy_check": "Does each bullet accurately reflect the product at this URL?",
  "balance_check": "Is there a mix of technical specs and practical benefits?",
  "length_check": "Is each bullet between 15-25 words?",
  "relevance_check": "Does each point matter to UK construction professionals?",
  "uniqueness_check": "Is each bullet distinct without overlap?",
  "benefit_clarity": "Is the 'why it matters' clear in each point?",
  "terminology_check": "Uses correct UK construction industry terms?",
  "scan_check": "Can bullets be quickly scanned and understood?",
  "value_check": "Does each point contribute to purchase decision?",
  "compliance_check": "Are any safety/standard claims accurate?",
  "quantification_check": "Are benefits specific rather than vague?"
}
```

**Output Contract**:
Return ONLY the bullet points. Use • character. No headers, no numbers, no additional formatting. Plain text bullets only.

**Example Output Format**:
• Heavy-duty 140L steel drum - Handles multiple batches without overheating during continuous site work
• 650W electric motor with thermal protection - Maintains consistent mixing power while preventing costly burnouts
• Tilting mechanism with safety lock - Enables controlled pouring reducing waste and worker strain
• IP44 weatherproof rating - Operates reliably in typical UK weather conditions year-round
• Meets BS EN 12151 safety standards - Ensures full compliance for professional construction sites
• Portable wheel kit included - Saves 20 minutes setup time when moving between work areas

## **Rationale:**
This prompt leverages the playbook's principles by:
- **Defining explicit constraints** with word counts per bullet and total bullet count
- **Providing structured templates** for consistent feature-benefit pairing
- **Implementing category coverage** ensuring comprehensive yet focused content
- **Using rigorous validation** through an 11-point JSON self-check protocol
- **Enforcing clean output** with strict formatting requirements
- **Balancing technical and practical** content for professional audience engagement
- **Incorporating quantification** for concrete value demonstration

## **Adaptations/Tips:**
- Replace `{URL}`, `{PRODUCT_TITLE}`, and `{INTRO_PARAGRAPH}` with actual values
- Features & Benefits sections have highest impact on conversion rates
- Test different orderings: technical-first vs benefit-first bullets
- For complex products, prioritize the 5 most compelling points over trying to cover everything
- Track which bullet points users hover over or click (if interactive)
- Consider seasonal adjustments (e.g., weatherproofing benefits in winter)
- For Gerald McDonald, emphasize professional-grade features that justify premium positioning
- Monitor competitor bullet points to ensure differentiation
- Use heat mapping to optimize bullet point ordering based on user attention
