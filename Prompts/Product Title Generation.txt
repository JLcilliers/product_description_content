## **Rationale:**
This prompt applies the playbook's core principles by:
- **Defining clear work units** with explicit task, requirements, non-goals, and acceptance tests
- **Providing rich context** about Gerald McDonald's business and target market
- **Incorporating self-checks** through the JSON validation protocol that ensures relevance, SEO quality, and accuracy
- **Using strict output contracts** that specify exactly what should be returned (just the title)
- **Applying effort controls** with "prioritize accuracy and SEO effectiveness over speed"
- **Being concrete and specific** with character limits, structure templates, and industry-specific requirements

## **Adaptations/Tips:**
- For implementation, replace `{URL}` with the actual product URL being analyzed
- Consider caching the system message if processing multiple products
- Track performance metrics: Click-through rates and search rankings
- A/B test variations focusing on keyword placement
- For Gerald McDonald specifically, emphasize UK spelling and terminology (e.g., "aluminium" not "aluminum")
- If using with web scraping tools, ensure the AI can access product images and specifications for accuracy
